/* API routes that should be created:
GET /api/notes should read the db.json file * return all saved notes as JSON.

POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, 
add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client.
-find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm 
packages)
